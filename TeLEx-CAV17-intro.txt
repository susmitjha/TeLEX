Executive Summary Instructions
To Run Experiments in Draft
With the VM Image.

Boot up and open a terminal.

Activate conda environment named telex
> source activate telex
> cd /home/telex/TeLEX/tests
> ./runallgradientonly.sh
If you look inside sh script, it is calling
python test_scale.py -i 10 -o gradient
that is, run test_scale.py with iterations set to 10
and choice of optimizer set to gradient.
This will run all 12 STL learning problems (10 times each)
and keep reporting the results to the screen as well as summary
results to scale_gradient_10.log file.
The summaries in scale_gradient_10.log have intermediate tables
after each set of 10 repetitions. synth.log has logging from
the tool.

Look at log files in /home/telex/TeLEX/tests/scale-results/run-gradient/
for what to expect. 

Similarly, do
> ./runall.sh 
to run both gradient and non-gradient optimizers.
Note that non-gradient is very slow as reported in the
draft. Its results are also cached in 
/home/telex/TeLEX/tests/scale-results/run-nogradient/

Setting Up Python and Conda
----------------------------------
Downloaded Conda for 32 bit Ubuntu Linux from https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install#linux-install: Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

Install it by running.
> bash Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
Installed to /home/telex/anaconda2
Added it to path in ~/.bashrc

Installed emacs 

Added sources to ~/TeLEX

Python 2.7 comes preinstalled with Ubuntu 14.04


TeLEx Installation
-----------------------------------
> conda env create -f telex.yml
This will install all dependencies.
Fetched a bunch of packages listed in yml file.

Added ~/TeLEX to PYTHONPATH in .bashrc

Guideline for reproducing results in submission
-------------------------------------------------

Boot up and open a terminal.

Activate conda environment named telex
> source activate telex
> cd /home/telex/TeLEX/tests
> ./runallgradientonly.sh
If you look inside sh script, it is calling
python test_scale.py -i 10 -o gradient
that is, run test_scale.py with iterations set to 10
and choice of optimizer set to gradient.
This will run all 12 STL learning problems (10 times each)
and keep reporting the results to the screen as well as summary
results to scale_gradient_10.log file.
The summaries in scale_gradient_10.log have intermediate tables
after each set of 10 repetitions. synth.log has logging from
the tool.

Look at log files in /home/telex/TeLEX/tests/scale-results/run-gradient/
for what to expect. 

Similarly, do
> ./runall.sh 
to run both gradient and non-gradient optimizers.
Note that non-gradient is very slow as reported in the
draft. Its results are also cached in 
/home/telex/TeLEX/tests/scale-results/run-nogradient/

The other test_*.py examples in tests directory of
the tool distribution further illustrate
how TeLEX can be used. 

If you want to go one level under the hood,
look at python test_scale.py -i 10 -o gradient
which recieved two inputs: number of iterations for
each testcase and the optimization method which can be
gradient or nogradient.
In the python file, you will see how STL templates
are provided along with trace directory, and then
call is made to the main learning function in synth.py:
telex.synth.synthSTLParam 
This is the function described in Tool Architecture 
section of the draft. 
 
Hope you have fun playing with the tool!
